					<h2>Research Assistant - BYU Hydroinformatics Lab</h2>
                    <h3>April 2018 - Present</h3>
                    <p>
                        Our goal is to provide water and environmental modeling tools, especially for use in less-developed areas of
                        the world. Traditional methods of water and environmental modeling are important there but, because of the cost,
                        expertise, infrastructure and time requirements, are often inaccessible or not feasible. We use remote sensing
                        and GIS data to run our models and provide access to them through a graphical user interface by writing simple
                        web applications. These tools are built on free and open source software and data so they can be applied globaly
                        at little if any cost. See <a href="http://worldwater.byu.edu">worldwater.byu.edu</a> for more about our lab.

                    <h2>ASCE BYU Chapter Officers - Networking Committee</h2>
                    <h3>April 2018 - April 2019</h3>
                    <p>
                        I was elected to the BYU ASCE Student Chapter's Networking Committee. Seeking to help students market themselves
                        to recruiters and be better prepared for post-graduation plans, our ASCE chapter decided to form a networking
                        committee. Our goal was to connect students with businesses and get support in related skills such as interviewing,
                        building a LinkedIn profile, and writing resumes. The highlight of our service were two networking dinner events
                        where we hosted recruiters from 17 companies and almost 100 students for a 3 hour dinner and social event. These
                        and our other events were the first largely successful networking events attempted by our student chapter in many years.

                    <h2>President - RCH Engineering</h2>
                    <h3>Founded January 21 2018</h3>
                    <p>
                        I’m officially registered with the state of Arizona as an engineering business owner. I’ve done consulting
                        like work for a handful of businesses. Not very much technical work since I’m not a PE obviously but I’ve
                        done drafting and computer modeling, all kinds of computer/technology consulting and setup, and helping
                        connect businesses with the right kind of engineers for what they need. I’ve made some money but I mostly
                        pursued that as a cheap and fun way to learn more of the fine details of how businesses work and get some
                        experience with that. I hear people complain that they don’t feel prepared for business aspects of
                        engineering so I thought that would be fun and I’ve got some good experience through it.

					<h2>Geomatics Teaching Assistant</h2>
                    <h3>April 2017 - April 2018</h3>
                    <p>
                        I was a teaching assistant for BYU course CEEN 114. The course taught surveying skills and simple GIS skills with
                        ESRI's ArcMap software in weekly lab sections taught by the TA. I personally developed 8 of the 13 lab assignments used in
                        in the class and assisted the Professor in writing the final exam. Samples of those lab assignments listed below.
