                    <p>
                        Our goal is to provide water and environmental modeling tools, especially for use in less-developed areas of
                        the world. Traditional methods of water and environmental modeling are important there but, because of the cost,
                        expertise, infrastructure and time requirements, are often inaccessible or not feasible. We use remote sensing
                        and GIS data to run our models and provide access to them through a graphical user interface by writing simple
                        web applications. These tools are built on free and open source software and data so they can be applied globaly
                        at little if any cost. See <a href="http://worldwater.byu.edu">worldwater.byu.edu</a> for more about our lab.

                    <h3>Founded January 21 2018</h3>
                    <p>
                        I’m officially registered with the state of Arizona as an engineering business owner. I’ve done consulting
                        like work for a handful of businesses. Not very much technical work since I’m not a PE obviously but I’ve
                        done drafting and computer modeling, all kinds of computer/technology consulting and setup, and helping
                        connect businesses with the right kind of engineers for what they need. I’ve made some money but I mostly
                        pursued that as a cheap and fun way to learn more of the fine details of how businesses work and get some
                        experience with that. I hear people complain that they don’t feel prepared for business aspects of
                        engineering so I thought that would be fun and I’ve got some good experience through it.

                    <p>
                        I was a teaching assistant for BYU course CEEN 114. The course taught surveying skills and simple GIS skills with
                        ESRI's ArcMap software in weekly lab sections taught by the TA. I personally developed 8 of the 13 lab assignments used in
                        in the class and assisted the Professor in writing the final exam. Samples of those lab assignments listed below.

                        for a 6 thousand dollar scholarship. The subject is Cuban infrastructure. My team of three wrote an
                        approximately 4 thousand word paper on how to use the global modeling and forecasting capabilities
                        developed in the Hydroinformatics lab where i was working at the time. I was the principal author
                        responsible for the majority of the writing and technical content. We invited them to adopt the

                        incident locations. The routes are generated on the basis of time, location, station capability,
                        obstructions in routes, and weather conditions. This is accomplished with the ArcGIS Network Analyst
                        tool. I worked on this app in a team of 3 as an exercise in transportation engineering and optimization.

                        For my senior project as an undergraduate civil engineering student at BYU, I worked with INDRHI, a government
                        water resources department of the Dominican Republic. They have roughly a dozen large reservoirs that supply
                        a considerable percentage of the water used in the country.

                        capabilities with django and python packages. The Tethys software package is used in international
                        communities to lower the technical and monetary barriers that prevent people from effectively performing
                        and sharing engineering analysis. This app lets users, especially app developers and administrators,
                        view how, when, where their applications are used. This is intended to be used as a check that apps are
                        being used by the intended audiences and for validation to project sponsors that end goals were met.

                        We choose to go to the moon in this decade and do the other things, not because they are easy, but
                        because they are hard, because that goal will serve to organize and measure the best of our energies
                        and skills, because that challenge is one that we are willing to accept, one we are unwilling to
                        postpone, and one which we intend to win, and the others, too.<br>

                        For the natural man is an enemy to God, and has been from the fall of Adam, and will be, forever and
                        ever, unless he yields to the enticings of the Holy Spirit, and putteth off the natural man and becometh
                        a saint through the atonement of Christ the Lord, and becometh as a child, submissive, meek, humble,
                        patient, full of love, willing to submit to all things which the Lord seeth fit to inflict upon him,
                        even as a child doth submit to his father.<br>
