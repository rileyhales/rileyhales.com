                        We choose to go to the moon in this decade and do the other things, not because they are easy, but
                        because they are hard, because that goal will serve to organize and measure the best of our energies
                        and skills, because that challenge is one that we are willing to accept, one we are unwilling to
                        postpone, and one which we intend to win, and the others, too.<br>

                        For the natural man is an enemy to God, and has been from the fall of Adam, and will be, forever and
                        ever, unless he yields to the enticings of the Holy Spirit, and putteth off the natural man and becometh
                        a saint through the atonement of Christ the Lord, and becometh as a child, submissive, meek, humble,
                        patient, full of love, willing to submit to all things which the Lord seeth fit to inflict upon him,
                        even as a child doth submit to his father.<br>
                        <i>King Benjamin, Mosiah 3:19, The Book of Mormon</i>
                    </p>
